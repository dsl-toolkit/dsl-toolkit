**Cowlog is not meant to be included in any production code, as it might create
performance issues.** 
However, the tool provides you the ability to see where it is used in your code,
so it can safely and easily removed. Cowlog let you see the **stacktrace** up until
where from this tool called. **All the log messages** per process are
**collected to a separate file**.

# Cowlog

Cowlog is made for developers by the vidaxl.com, helping them to debug their
application. It is a library that helps you identify your debug message quickly
on the console output. The project is meant to be used solely in a
**nodejs environment** as these days browsers provide really neat standard
toolsets for debugging your applications.

We want dsl-toolkit to be usable in any circumstances without problems therfore we
have 100% code coverage.


## Motivation

- Server side applications tend to pollute the console still sometimes you want
to use console.log, and not solely use the amazing debug mode
[--inspect](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/)
of the node.js.

- CowLog can help you refactoring your code faster. it runs on every node.js
environment >= 4.0.0

## Installation
```bash
npm install cowlog --save-dev
```

## Usage
For [more documentation click here](./documentation/logging_functionality.md)
this document will leverage the power of the logging capabilities of this
library.

### Remarks

If you don't have a golbal variable registered to l (cowlog.log) or lf
(cowlog.lf) than cowlog will register them, so you can reach it from anywhere.
I know it is against all good practice, but don't forget cowlog is used in
developmnet time only.
